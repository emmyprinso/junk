npm install firebase-tools -g      //this will install the fools needed for firebase 



firebase init hosting              // navigate to the folder you want to use for firebase stuff and run this command

//to import the firebase web SDK to the index.js file you need the following lines of code
<script defer src="/__/firebase/4.10.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script defer src="/__/firebase/4.10.1/firebase-auth.js"></script>
<script defer src="/__/firebase/4.10.1/firebase-database.js"></script>

// when the execution has completed




firebase serve                      //this will serve the firebase app locally on a port probably localhost:5000
firebase deploy                     //this will deploy our app to the internet and return to us a valid url that is accessible on the internet



//remember that when you execute the <firebase init hosting> a folder was created with some files and folders 
//Now to create a file eg <app.js> use the following command

touch public/app.js         //where public is the folder where the app.js file reside

firebase serve              //start running the firebase app
